# Olist Marketplace Data Analysis

## Project Overview
Olist, the largest online marketplace in Brazil, is conducting a company-wide performance review. As part of the Data team, our task is to analyze the company's extensive data to assess past performance and identify future opportunities. This report aims to present our findings in an informative and engaging manner to support the decision-making of various business unit leaders.

## Data Description
The dataset encompasses a wide array of information related to product orders on the Olist platform, including:

- Price and shipping costs for each product in an order
- Seller and buyer locations
- Product details (dimensions, number of photos, category)
- Customer review scores for each order
- Order status (delivered, cancelled, etc.)
- Order timestamps (purchase date, approval date, estimated and actual delivery dates)

It's important to note that a single order can contain multiple products.

## Objectives
The analysis focuses on addressing key questions raised by the Head of Business Development, including:

- The relationship between seller and buyer locations
- Opportunities for growth in different product categories
- Potential for expansion in areas with low commercial activity ("commerce dead zones")

## Analysis Approach
The analysis includes the following key components:

- **Geographical Analysis**: Mapping buyer and seller locations to visualize geographical distribution and aggregation by sales/purchase volume.
- **Distance and Order Size Relationship**: Calculating distances between buyers and sellers and exploring the relationship with order size through regression analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting EDA using buyer/seller city and state data, including cross-tabulation of states and independence testing.
- **Growth Opportunities**:
  - Visualizing growth in sales volume by product category over time.
  - Identifying high-price, small-dimension products as potential profit drivers.
  - Performing ANOVA or Tukey HSD tests to compare sales or volume across product categories.
  - Identifying commerce dead zones using geographical mapping.
